# Counting number of triangles in an undirected graph

An undirected graph is a graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected, where all the edges are bidirectional. An undirected graph is sometimes called an undirected network. In contrast, a graph where the edges point in a direction is called a directed graph.

A graph with n vertices is dense if it has Î¸ (n2) edges and is sparse otherwise. This means that a graph is dense if the average degree of each vertex is lineal, and sparse if sub-lineal.

We plan to implement an efficient algorithm to count the number of triangles parallelly on a GPU. Also compare the performance of our implementation with the reference implementation and previous 15-418 implementation of the students.

## Code setup

## Problem Statement

Given an undirected simple graph, we need to find how many triangles it can have. For example, the graph below has 2 triangles in it.

## Serial Implementation

Let A[][] be an adjacency matrix representation of a graph. If we calculate A3, then the number of triangles in the Undirected Graph is equal to trace(A3) / 6. Where trace(A) is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal of matrix A.

If we compute An for an adjacency matrix representation of a graph, then a value An[i][j] represents the number of distinct walks between vertex i to j in the graph. In A3, we get all distinct paths of length 3 between every pair of vertices.

A triangle is a cyclic path of length three, i.e., begins and ends at the same vertex. So A3[i][i] represents a triangle beginning and ending with vertex i. Since a triangle has three vertices and it is counted for every vertex, we need to divide the result by 3. Furthermore, since the graph is undirected, every triangle is twice as (i-p-d-j) and (i-q-p-j), so we divide by 2 also. Therefore, the number of triangles is trace(A3).

#### Run Code

` nvcc serial.cu`
`a.exe ./sample_graph.txt`

##Parallel Implementation
It has never been simple to solve the problem of counting the number of triangles, moreover not so exciting doing it in O(n^3) and O(3xn) space. There are many implementations available using techniques such as map-reduce, GraphLab, etc.

Our reference paper claims to have a very efficient implementation, using subgraph matching to a triangle pattern, in recent times and we will try to have our own implementation of their algorithm and beat their performance as well as the similar previous years 15-418 projects.

As mentioned, our biggest challenge would be to optimize the authors algorithm further and also optimize the memory usage, the most tricky part would be the communication part between the cores computing the subgraphs.
